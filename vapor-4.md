[Vapor](https://vapor.codes) is currently one of the most popular server-side Swift frameworks. It allows you to take the language you already know if you ever developed an iOS application and use it in a whole new way, to develop fast, scalable and reliable back-end systems that integrate easily with a wide range of third party services. This is a curated list of:

- modern libraries that easily integrate with Vapor and follow Vapor’s philosophy of providing simple, clean yet powerful APIs;
- well-written tutorials, books, videos and education materials;
- tools to make your development process simpler and more enjoyable;
- and more!
